/* Coding Challenge #15
1. Re-create Challenge #114, but this time using an ES6 class (call it 'CarCl')
2. Add a getter called 'speedUS' which returns the current speed in mi/h (divide
by 1.6)
3. Add a setter called 'speedUS' which sets the current speed in mi/h (but
converts it to km/h before storing the value, by multiplying the input by 1.6)
4. Create a new car and experiment with the 'accelerate' and 'brake'
methods, and with the getter and setter.
Test data:
ยง Data car 1: 'Ford' going at 120 km/h */

class Car {
  constructor(make, speed) {
    this.make = make;
    this.speed = speed;
  }
  accelerate() {
    this.speed += 10;
    console.log(`Current speed of the ${this.make} is ${this.speed} km/h`);
  }

  brake() {
    this.speed -= 5;
    console.log(`Current speed of the ${this.make} is ${this.speed} km/h`);
  }
  get speedUs() {
    return this.speed / 1.6;
  }

  set speedUs(speed) {
    this.speed = speed * 1.6;
  }
}

const ford = new Car("Ford", 120);

ford.accelerate();
console.log(ford.speedUs);
ford.speedUs = 50;
console.log(ford);
